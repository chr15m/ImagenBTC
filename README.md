This is a heavily modified fork of zalewszczak's watchface "brown".

I am displaying the time, date, current weather, user locale, and a custom message from the server.

No license was found so I assume public domain. I license my modification under the GPLv3.

Edit [The build config file](src/build_config.h) to customise the settings.
